Create a traffic light system where the lights cycle from green to yellow to red at set intervals, and continue to loop indefinitely. Here are the durations for each light:

Red light: 4000ms
Yellow light: 500ms
Green light: 3000ms
Feel free to get creative with the design and appearance of the traffic light! For reference, you can check out this https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Traffic_lights_3_states.svg
